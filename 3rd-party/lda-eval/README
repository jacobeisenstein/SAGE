Notes: 

Slight modifications by Jacob Eisenstein on Jan 24 2011.
Substituted lightspeed's "sample" for the insanely slow discreternd.
Now works much faster.

Some simple Matlab routines that implement a subset of the methods considered in:

The actual functions for getting p(w|Phi,alpha)
-----------------------------------------------

ldae_*.m

ldae_chibms.m        - Murray & Salakhutdinov
ldae_dumb_exact.m    - Sums over all settings of z. Does this in a dumb way. Maybe
                       redo better code and/or in a different programming language.
ldae_hm.m            - Harmonic mean
ldae_is_variants.m   - Various ways of importance sampling z's
ldae_upper_bound.m   - for synthetic docs, compute log-prob if we know theta. We
                       can't do better than this (at least on average). But HM
                       will often claim we are.
ldae_w2_is_theta.m   - document completion by importance sampling p(theta|w1) to predict w2
ldae_wei.m           - importance sample theta

ldae_by_discretization_base.m - used for ldae_wei and allows deterministic setting of theta "samples"
                                HOWEVER, I should use a decent quasi-Monte Carlo algorithm for this.
                                I didn't find the time.
ldae_by_discretization.m - dumb discretization of theta space. Doesn't actually
    work robustly, because the Dirichlet prior is pretty nasty in theta space.
    (Generic adaptive quadrature has problems in this parameterization too.)
